# car-price-prediction
This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting car prices based on various features such as make, model, mileage, and other specifications. The project is implemented in Python and utilizes Jupyter Notebook for interactive analysis. Future plans include deploying the project using Flask on Heroku.

Features

1-Data cleaning and preprocessing

2-Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and patterns

3-Model building using regression techniques

4-Hyperparameter tuning for optimizing model performance

5-Evaluation of model accuracy

Technologies Used

1-Python

2-Jupyter Notebook

3-Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation

4-Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization

5-Scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms

Project Workflow

1-Importing Dependencies:
Load necessary libraries and frameworks for the project.

2-Data Loading and Cleaning:
Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and prepare the dataset for modeling.

3-Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Use visualizations to understand data distributions, correlations, and trends.

4-Model Development:
Train machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, or other regression techniques.

5-Evaluation:
Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.

6-Prediction:
Use the trained model to predict car prices on new data.

7-Deployment (Planned):
Build a Flask application for serving predictions and deploy it on Heroku for public access
